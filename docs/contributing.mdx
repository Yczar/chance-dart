# Contributing

Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page

### Filing issues

In your issue, make sure to include the following items:

- Add a descriptive title, e.g. include package name, search term or the specific error label from the analysis tab.
- URL of the page you are reporting something (using the "Report an issue" link on the page does this).
- Screenshot of the page (if relevant).
- The device you are using (if relevant).

### Before you contribute code

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
recommend [forking the repository][fork], making changes in your fork, and
[sending us a pull request][pr] so we can review the changes and merge them into
this repository. Note that this package doesn't use the Dart formatter. The
reviewer will reformat your code themselves if necessary.

Functional changes will require tests to be added or changed. The tests live in
the `test/` directory, and are run with `pub run test`. If you need to create
new tests, use the existing tests as a guideline for what they should look like.

Before you send your pull request, make sure all the tests pass! Just run
`pub run test`.
